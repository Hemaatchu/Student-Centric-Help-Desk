## Student-Centric Help Desk
The Student-Centric Help Desk integrates an AI-powered chatbot to assist students by providing instant responses to academic, administrative, and campus-related queries, thereby improving accessibility, efficiency, and overall student support experience.

## About
The Student-Centric Help Desk is an intelligent chatbot-based system designed to simplify and automate student support services in educational institutions. Traditional student help desks often rely on manual processes, leading to delays, repetitive queries, and increased workload for administrative staff.

This project addresses these challenges by implementing an AI-driven chatbot that understands natural language queries and provides accurate, real-time responses related to academics, admissions, examinations, fees, hostel facilities, and general campus information. The system offers a user-friendly interface that ensures 24/7 availability and enhances communication between students and institutions.

## Features
AI-powered chatbot for student query handling

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user inputs

Web-based interactive interface

Faster response time compared to manual help desks

High scalability for handling multiple users simultaneously

Structured chatbot responses using JSON data format

Reduced workload on administrative staff
